    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Opening Classes</h3>

<p>Opening classes brings much flexibility for ruby. It permits you to modify existed classes or modules permanently, without having to implement whole world in case you just need to give a simple patch for current tool. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class String
  def to_alphanumeric
    gsub(/[^\w\s]/, '')
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>to_alphanumeric is new interface to return only alpha and numeric part of a string. However, opening class may not work well, especially it&rsquo;s commonly dangerous to opening a frequently used target which would cause unexpected error in code. Due to this reason someone calls opening classes monkey patch and just leaves far from this feature.</p>

<p>While whatever, monkey patch continues conciseness in ruby, sometimes you are able to save your life gracefully with such powerful tool, except the trap behind it.</p>

<h3>Refinements</h3>

<p>From ruby 2.0, there is a more advanced form of monkey patch which is called refinements. Refinements are providing a way to extend classes only under specific scope, but not including modules. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class C
  def foo
    puts "C#foo"
  end
end

module M
  refine C do
    def foo
      puts "C#foo in M"
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Module#refine creates an anonymous module that contains the changes or refinements to the class (C in the example). self in the refine block is this anonymous module similar to Module#module_eval.</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>

<p>We use using to activate refinements defined in any places, but you may only activate refinements at top-level, not inside any class, module or method scope. You may activate refinements in a string passed to Kernel#eval that is evaluated at top-level. Refinements are active until the end of the file or the end of the eval string, respectively.</p>

<p>Refinements are lexical in scope. When control is transferred outside the scope the refinement is deactivated. This means that when you require or load a file or call a method that is defined outside the current scope the refinement will be deactivated.</p>

<p>If a method is defined in a scope where a refinement is active the refinement will be active when the method is called.</p>

<p>When defining multiple refinements in the same module, inside a refine block all refinements from the same module are active when a refined method is called.</p>

<p>You may also activate refinements in a class or module definition, in which case the refinements are activated from the point where using is called to the end of the class or module definition.</p>

<h4>Method lookup under refinement</h4>

<p>When looking up a method for an instance of class C Ruby checks:</p>

<h5>1. If refinements are active for C, in the reverse order they were activated:</h5>

<p>  The prepended modules from the refinement for C</p>

<p>  The refinement for C</p>

<p>  The included modules from the refinement for C</p>

<h5>2. The prepended modules of C</h5>

<h5>3. C</h5>

<h5>4. The included modules of C</h5>

<p>If no method was found at any point this repeats with the superclass of C.</p>

<p>Note that methods in a subclass have priority over refinements in a superclass. For example, if the method / is defined in a refinement for Integer 1 / 2 invokes the original Fixnum#/ because Fixnum is a subclass of Integer and is searched before the refinements for the superclass Integer.</p>

<p>If a method foo is defined on Integer in a refinement, 1.foo invokes that method since foo does not exist on Fixnum.</p>

<h4>Super</h4>

<p>When super is invoked method lookup checks:</p>

<h5>The included modules of the current class. Note that the current class may be a refinement.</h5>

<h5>If the current class is a refinement, the method lookup proceeds as in the Method Lookup section above.</h5>

<h5>If the current class has a direct superclass, the method proceeds as in the Method Lookup section above using the superclass.</h5>

<p>Note that super in a method of a refinement invokes the method in the refined class even if there is another refinement which has been activated in the same context.</p>

<h4>Refinements and module inclusion</h4>

<p>Refinements are inherited by module inclusion. That is, using activates all refinements in the ancestors of the specified module. Refinements in a descendant have priority over refinements in an ancestor.</p>

<p>After all, refinement is still an experiment feature in ruby 2.x series, there is a detailed <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/RefinementsSpec">specification</a> in official website, which should cover most aspect of it.</p>

    <id>http://www.hanyi.name/blog/2015/09/08/metaprogramming-ruby-core-concepts-scope-and-self</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scope defines the circumstance around any ruby statement, which basically limits your accessibility to resources. But ruby also has implicit and complicate Constants/Methods lookup strategy to make things not so easy at all. This article will clarify the concepts about scope and self firstly, then deep into the Constants/Methods lookup strategy. Finally, let&rsquo;s try to understand top-level which may be the most special case in this topic.</p>

<h3>1. Scope</h3>

<p>In most cases, the &lsquo;Scope&rsquo; we say in ruby commonly refers to variable scope, which has a little bit different from other popular languages. For example, there are four basic variable scopes including local, global, instance and class level, none of them has business with each other. We&rsquo;ve already know the naming specification below:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Name begins with</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Variable scope</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">[a-z] or _</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">local variable   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">$         </td>
<td style="text-align:center;">global variable  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">@         </td>
<td style="text-align:center;">instance variable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">@@        </td>
<td style="text-align:center;">class variable   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Actually the tricky is not naming, it&rsquo;s about default scope changing. As we know that ruby has lexical scope, but not like others, it does not support nested scope, like inner scope shares outer scope in some languages. Each of four variable scopes in above figure is purely independent to each other.</p>

<h4>message &amp; scope resolution operator</h4>

<p>Dot . is message operator in ruby, mainly used for message receiving, like method call. Double colon :: is scope resolution operator, commonly used for getting constant in specific scope, Like Foo::Bar, means searching ./foo/bar with relative path. If Foo is undefined in current scope, you should always use ::Foo::Bar to figure it out using absolute path.</p>

<h4>scope changing</h4>

<p>There are four basic cases which may create and change the scope lexically: Class definitions (class), Module definitions (module), Methods (def) and Blocks. Block scope is a little bit different from others and more interesting, which would create its own scope after the block defined, but also have closure capability, like code below:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">foo = ''
bar = lambda { foo = 'hi' if foo == 'hello' }
foo = 'hello'
bar.call
foo #hi
</code></pre>

<p>For sure we can break this very easily:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">foo = ''
bar = lambda { |;foo| foo = 'hi' if foo == 'hello' }
foo = 'hello'
bar.call
foo #hello
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that |;foo| defines foo as a local variable in its block, this kind of feature was introduced from ruby 1.9.</p>

<h4>constants scope</h4>

<p>The scope we&rsquo;ve talked until now basically only means variable scope. In ruby, constant is totally different type of data compared with other languages like C++ or Java, any constant name must be started with uppercase character. And none of them can be assigned dynamically. Like:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def foo
  Bar = 'hello'
end #should give SyntaxError for dynamic constant assignment
</code></pre>

<p>Constants defined within a class or module can be accessed within its parent. And scope operator we talked before should be used when it&rsquo;s outside the class or module. Constants defined outside any class or module are global scope, can be accessed directly or by using the scope operator &lsquo;::&rsquo; with no prefix.</p>

<h3>2. Self</h3>

<p>As we know that the grail in ruby world would be conciseness. However, such conciseness is built on many bright solutions like keyword self.</p>

<p>if you just type a name in ruby console, it will show you an error:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">foo #NameError: undefined local variable or method `foo' for main:Object
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed it has a huge gap between ruby and other languages in such case. But the expression with only name as a statement in ruby really means asking for local variable first, if found nothing then go on for searching method defined by current object. Here &lsquo;main&rsquo; is a special object which represents the top-level, will have more discussion in the last part of this article.</p>

<h4>calling methods</h4>

<p>When you want to call a method, there should always be a receiver pointed to target object. Commonly that would be in this form:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">some_object.some_method
</code></pre>

<p>If some_object is omitted, some_method will be called on the object where the current scope belongs to. self is one of the keywords referring to the current object. Note that private is an exception in this case, we will show an example here which has already been introduced in last several articles talking about private and public.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def foo
  'Hello'
end

foo #Hello
self.foo #NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for main:Object
</code></pre>

<p>The most usage of self would be defining a class method, or getting singleton class of current class.</p>

<h3>3. Method lookup</h3>

<p>The order of name lookup should be local variable/constant, then method. We has discussed about variable and constant scope in the first part. Here let&rsquo;s have a look at method lookup.</p>

<p>When a message call happens, ruby will found its receiver firstly which should be an object. Since all methods are stored in classes and modules so method lookup walks these, not the objects themselves.</p>

<p>Here is the order of method lookup for the receiver’s class or module R:</p>

<h4>i. The prepended modules of R in reverse order.</h4>

<h4>ii. For a matching method in R.</h4>

<h4>iii. The included modules of R in reverse order.</h4>

<p>If R is a class with a superclass, this is repeated with R‘s superclass until a method is found. And once a match is found method lookup stops. If no match is found this repeats from the beginning, but looking for method_missing. The default method_missing is BasicObject#method_missing which raises a NameError when invoked.</p>

<h3>4. Understanding top-level</h3>

<p>May be you&rsquo;re not interested in top-level mechanism as a rails developer (You have to use top-level one day even you&rsquo;re only develop rails application), but you need to notice that ruby is also regarded as a powerful scripting language and already as a built-in tool in many popular OS distributions. We talk about top-level because it behaves different from any ruby official documents.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found a nice explanation about top-level <a href="https://banisterfiend.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/what-is-the-ruby-top-level/">here</a>, but there are some newer update in latest ruby, we&rsquo;ll go through this.</p>

<p>Most of us may know that top-level refers to main, which is an object of Object. You can prove it very easily like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">self #main
self.class #Object
</code></pre>

<p>But how about define a top-level method?</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def foo
  'hello'
end
foo #hello
method(:foo).owner #Object
Object.private_method_defined?(:foo) #true
self.class.private_instance_methods(false) #[:foo]
</code></pre>

<p>Does that look like a class definition? Even for the constant definition:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Foo = 'hello'
Object.const_defined?(:Foo, false) #true
</code></pre>

<p>It just looks like you&rsquo;re operating on class Object. Not only for this, we found that there can also use public, private, or include method, they are shadow in singleton_class of main:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">singleton_class.private_instance_methods(false) #[:public, :private, :include, :using, :define_method]
</code></pre>

<p>Based on our analyst above, we find a strange dual-nature of ruby top-level with some unexpected definitions in main object in purpose. Matz gives a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_thread/thread/7bb7b451a8f3cca7/98c4c62127b9d945">explanation</a> about design of top-level. You can also get more discussion <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1761148/where-are-methods-defined-at-the-ruby-top-level">here</a>. From my view, such unusual design exactly helps conciseness of this language, but also gains our confusion and curiosity.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-29T22:40:06+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.hanyi.name/blog/2015/08/29/metaprogramming-ruby-core-concepts-object-oriented-hierarchies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since last several articles, we&rsquo;ve gone through all basic but the most important internal definitions in Ruby lang. They are BasicObject, Object, Module, and Kernel, don&rsquo;t forget Class. The five composite the root of Object Oriented Hierarchies in Ruby world. One of their most useful benefit is incredible metaprogramming ability, which already provides people revolutionary tools like Ruby on Rails. Frankly speaking, the word metaprogramming makes itself too mysterious to be accepted by most people. Conciseness and Expressiveness - are the only purpose of this feature.</p>

<h3>1. Class</h3>

<p>Classes in Ruby are first-class objects, each class in Ruby is an instance of class Class. Typically, you create a new class by using: Class.new. When a new class is created, an object of type Class is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Name in this case). When Name.new is called to create a new object, the new method in Class is run by default. Classes, modules, and objects are interrelated, we will discuss more in next chapter.</p>

<h4>Public Class Methods</h4>

<h5>new</h5>

<p>Creates a new anonymous (unnamed) class with the given superclass (or Object if no parameter is given). You can give a class a name by assigning the class object to a constant. If a block is given, it is passed the class object, and the block is evaluated in the context of this class using class_eval.</p>

<h4>Public Instance Methods</h4>

<h5>allocate</h5>

<p>Allocates space for a new object of class&rsquo;s class and does not call initialize on the new instance. The returned object must be an instance of class.</p>

<h5>new</h5>

<p>Calls allocate to create a new object of class&rsquo;s class, then invokes that object&rsquo;s initialize method, passing it args. This is the method that ends up getting called whenever an object is constructed using .new.</p>

<h5>superclass</h5>

<p>Returns the superclass of class, or nil. Returns nil when the given class does not have a parent class.</p>

<h4>Private Instance Methods</h4>

<h5>inherited</h5>

<p>Callback invoked whenever a subclass of the current class is created.</p>

<h3>2. Hierarchy of Five Kings</h3>

<p>For more clearly, here we give a figure to cover all five items listed in preface. (We also list two guests in this figure to represent custom codes in the hierarchy)</p>

<p><img src="http://7xk84n.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/metaprogramming_ruby/ruby_oo_hierarchy.png" alt="More advance Ruby OO hierarchy" /></p>

<p>From the figure, we can see that class can be completely separated with objects under well design. Ruby uses this kind of hierarchy to implement its internal Object Oriented design. Here we would like to introduce the responsibilities on metaprogramming for each in above figure, and have deeper discussion on Module and Class, which are directly related to custom codes.</p>

<h4>BasicObject</h4>

<p>BasicObject is the root of all objects in Ruby through its subclass Object. The only class method in BasicObject is &lsquo;new&rsquo;, which is used to allocate memory to new object, and do initialization. For the public instance methods, mainly including object_id, send, and instance_eval/instance_exec to provide basic operations on any objects in Ruby. Also, BasicObject figures out the method_missing mechanism, which is very important for Ruby DSL definition, and singleton methods hook — which actually connects classes and objects in Ruby.</p>

<h4>Object</h4>

<p>If any class is defined by using keyword &lsquo;class&rsquo; without other specific inheritance, it should be inherited from Object by default. Object offers the top useful Constants in Ruby world, like ARGV, ENV, RUBY_VERSION, STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR, etc. Also for public instance methods, it provides objects comparison, clone/dup, freezing, and respond_to? checking, etc.</p>

<p>In metaprogramming field, Object mainly focus on instance level usage, like getting class of object, extend, instance_of?, methods, retrieving singleton_class/singleton_methods of object. etc.</p>

<h4>Kernel</h4>

<p>Kernel is very special in the hierarchy, because it&rsquo;s absolutely not class but an object. On the other hand, Kernel is mixed into class Object, making it become the earliest members in the whole hierarchy and also play very important role in the process.</p>

<p>Unlike Object, Constants in Kernel do not refer to some parameters of internal Ruby lang, they&rsquo;re more like an utility or tool kit for subclasses, especially the reference to popular classes. Kernel also plays hard in Process operations(abort, fork, spawn), Source file loading(auto loading, require), Exception(catch, fail, raise, throw), String(chomp, chop, format, gets, gsub, sprintf, sub), Controlling(loop, sleep, rand, srand, trace/untrace), and IO(open, print, put, readlines, select).</p>

<p>Kernel also enhances the metaprogramming, like binding, block_given?, caller, eval, lambda, and proc.</p>

<h3>3. Modules and Classes</h3>

<h4>Module</h4>

<p>Basically, Modules serve two purposes in Ruby: namespacing and mix-in functionality.</p>

<p>A namespace can be used to organize code by package or functionality that separates common names from interference by other packages. Mix-in functionality allows sharing common methods across multiple classes or modules. Ruby comes with the Enumerable mix-in module which provides many enumeration methods based on the each method and Comparable allows comparison of objects based on the &lt;=> comparison method.</p>

<p>A module is created using the module keyword.</p>

<h4>Class</h4>

<p>Every class is also a module, but unlike modules a class may not be mixed-in to another module (or class). Like a module, a class can be used as a namespace. A class also inherits methods and constants from its superclass. Use the class keyword to create a class. Any method defined on a class is callable from its subclass, the same is true for constants. You can override the functionality of a superclass method by redefining the method. If you wish to invoke the superclass functionality from a method use super.</p>

<p>If you do not supply a superclass your new class will inherit from Object. You may inherit from a different class using &lt; followed by a class name.</p>

<p>When used without any arguments super uses the arguments given to the subclass method. To send no arguments to the superclass method use super(). To send specific arguments to the superclass method provide them manually like super(2). super may be called as many times as you like in the subclass method.</p>

<h4>Common properties</h4>

<p>Note that there are many similarities between modules and classes. Besides the ability to mix-in a module, the description of modules also applies to classes.</p>

<h5>Reopening</h5>

<p>Reopening classes is a very powerful feature of Ruby, but it is best to only reopen classes you own. Otherwise it may lead to naming conflicts or difficult to diagnose bugs.</p>

<h5>Nesting</h5>

<p>Modules may be nested.</p>

<h5>Packaging</h5>

<p>Many packages create a single outermost module (or class) to provide a namespace for their functionality. You may also define inner modules using :: provided the outer modules (or classes) are already defined.</p>

<h5>Self</h5>

<p>self refers to the object that defines the current scope. And it will change when entering a different method or when defining a new module.</p>

<h5>Constants</h5>

<p>Accessible constants are different depending on the module nesting (which syntax was used to define the module). if you use :: to define A::B without nesting it inside A a NameError exception will be raised because the nesting does not include A. If a constant is defined at the top-level you may preceded it with :: to reference it.</p>

<h5>Methods</h5>

<p>Class methods may be called directly(This is slightly confusing, but a method on a module is often called a “class method” instead of a “module method”. See also Module#module_function which can convert an instance method into a class method.). When a class method references a constant it uses the same rules as referencing it outside the method as the scope is the same.
Instance methods defined in a module are only callable when included. These methods have access to the constants defined when they were included through the ancestors list.</p>

<h5>Visibility</h5>

<p>Ruby has three types of visibility. The default is public. A public method may be called from any other object.</p>

<p>The second visibility is protected. When calling a protected method the sender must be a subclass of the receiver or the receiver must be a subclass of the sender. Otherwise a NoMethodError will be raised. Protected visibility is most frequently used to define == and other comparison methods where the author does not wish to expose an object&rsquo;s state to any caller and would like to restrict it only to inherited classes.</p>

<p>The third visibility is private. A private method may not be called with a receiver, not even self. If a private method is called with a receiver a NoMethodError will be raised.</p>

<h5>Alias and Undef</h5>

<p>You may also alias or undefine methods, but these operations are not restricted to modules or classes.</p>

<h3>4. Singleton classes</h3>

<p>The singleton class (also known as the metaclass or eigenclass) of an object is a class that holds methods for only that instance. You can access the singleton class of an object using class &lt;&lt; object like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Foo
  class &lt;&lt; self
    # self is the singleton class here
  end
end

class &lt;&lt; Foo
  # self is the singleton class here
end
</code></pre>

<p>This allows definition of methods and attributes on a class (or module) without needing to write def self.my_method.</p>

<p>Since you can open the singleton class of any object this means that this code block:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">bar = Object.new

def bar.bar_method
  1 + 1
end
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to this code block:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; bar</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  def bar_method</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    1 + 1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Understanding singleton class in ruby is very important to investigate internal ruby, especially for its OO design. In next article, we&rsquo;ll introduce the scope mechanism in ruby.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Kernel is the object of Module, thus it has all instance methods from the parent. Also it&rsquo;s available as instance methods in every Ruby object since the Kernel is included by class Object. Kernel has widespread usage including but not limit to internal Constant references, Processes operations, Loading Strategies, Exceptions, Controlling, IO, and Basic string operations. This article will focus on metaprogramming on instance level.</p>

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>All Constants and instance methods are public in Kernel, thus they all can be used in any objects as callee.</p>

<h5>binding</h5>

<p>Returns a Binding object, describing the variable and method bindings at the point of call. This object can be used when calling eval to execute the evaluated command in this environment.</p>

<h5>eval</h5>

<p>Evaluates the Ruby expression(s) in string. If the binding is given, which must be a Binding object, the evaluation is performed in its context. If the optional filename and lineno parameters are present, they will be used when reporting syntax errors.</p>

<h5>block_given? / iterator?</h5>

<p>Returns true if yield would execute a block in the current context. The iterator? form is mildly deprecated.</p>

<h5>callcc{|cont| block}</h5>

<p>Generates a Continuation object, which it passes to the associated block. You need to require &lsquo;continuation&rsquo; before using this method. Performing a cont.call will cause the callcc to return (as will falling through the end of the block). The value returned by the callcc is the value of the block, or the value passed to cont.call.
In general, Continuation object is used to be analogous to C setjmp/longjmp, or a thread. cont will return itself, and cont.call will jump to end of callcc block.</p>

<h5>caller</h5>

<p>Returns the current execution stack—an array containing strings in the form file:line or file:line: in &lsquo;method&rsquo;. Returns nil if start is greater than the size of current execution stack. Optionally you can pass a range, which will return an array containing the entries within the specified range.</p>

<h5>caller_locations</h5>

<p>Returns the current execution stack—an array containing backtrace location objects. Returns nil if start is greater than the size of current execution stack. Optionally you can pass a range, which will return an array containing the entries within the specified range.</p>

<h5>eval</h5>

<p>Evaluates the Ruby expression(s) in string. If binding is given, which must be a Binding object, the evaluation is performed in its context. If the optional filename and lineno parameters are present, they will be used when reporting syntax errors.</p>

<h5>global_variables</h5>

<p>Lookup global variables.</p>

<h5>lambda</h5>

<p>Equivalent to Proc.new, except the resulting Proc objects check the number of parameters passed when called.</p>

<h5>proc</h5>

<p>Equivalent to Proc.new</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For internal ruby, Module is mainly used for holding class methods for descendants. Suppose each object has class of A, A always has class of Class, and Class inherits from Module, thus class A should hold all class methods from instance methods in Module. On the other hand, user can mix in self defined Module to provide more instance methods for their class, or use module function directly.</p>

<h3>Module</h3>

<p>Module provides two kinds of class level metaprogramming methods, either public or private. Each of them has different usage for building descendants.</p>

<h4>Public instance methods</h4>

<h5>ancestors</h5>

<p>Returns a list of modules included/prepended in current module.</p>

<h5>class_eval</h5>

<p>Evaluates the string or block in the context of module, except that when a block is given, constant/class variable lookup is not affected. This can be used to add methods to a class. class_eval returns the result of evaluating its argument.</p>

<h5>class_exec</h5>

<p>Evaluates the given block in the context of the class/module. The method defined in the block will belong to the receiver. Any arguments passed to the method will be passed to the block. This can be used if the block needs to access instance variables.</p>

<h5>class_variable_defined?</h5>

<p>Returns true if the given class variable is defined in object.</p>

<h5>class_variable_get</h5>

<p>Returns the value of the given class variable (or throws a NameError exception). The @@ part of the variable name should be included for regular class variables.</p>

<h5>class_variable_set</h5>

<p>Sets the class variable named by symbol to the given object.</p>

<h5>class_variables</h5>

<p>Returns an array of the names of class variables in current module. This includes the names of class variables in any included modules, unless the inherit parameter is set to false.</p>

<h5>const_defined?</h5>

<p>Says whether module or its ancestors have a constant with the given name: If module is a Module, additionally Object and its ancestors are checked. In each of the checked classes or modules, if the constant is not present but there is an autoload for it, true is returned directly without autoloading. If the constant is not found the callback const_missing is not called and the method returns false. If inherit is false, the lookup only checks the constants in the receiver. In this case, the same logic for autoloading applies. If the argument is not a valid constant name a NameError is raised with the message “wrong constant name name”.</p>

<h5>const_get</h5>

<p>Checks for a constant with the given name in module. If inherit is set, the lookup will also search the ancestors (and Object if module is a Module). The value of the constant is returned if a definition is found, otherwise a NameError is raised. This method will recursively look up constant names if a namespaced class name is provided.</p>

<h5>const_missing</h5>

<p>Invoked when a reference is made to an undefined constant in module. It is passed a symbol for the undefined constant, and returns a value to be used for that constant. If found, it returns the loaded class. It therefore implements an autoload feature similar to Kernel#autoload and #autoload.</p>

<h5>const_set</h5>

<p>Sets the named constant to the given object, returning that object. Creates a new constant if no constant with the given name previously existed. If symbol or string is not a valid constant name a NameError will be raised with a warning “wrong constant name”.</p>

<h5>constants</h5>

<p>Returns an array of the names of the constants accessible in module. This includes the names of constants in any included modules, unless the inherit parameter is set to false.</p>

<h5>instance_method</h5>

<p>Returns an UnboundMethod representing the given instance method in module.</p>

<h5>instance_methods</h5>

<p>Returns an array containing the names of the public and protected instance methods in the receiver. For a module, these are the public and protected methods; for a class, they are the instance (not singleton) methods.</p>

<h5>method_defined?</h5>

<p>Returns true if the named method is defined by module (or its included modules and, if module is a class, its ancestors). Public and protected methods are matched. String arguments are converted to symbols.</p>

<h5>module_eval</h5>

<p>Evaluates the string or block in the context of module, except that when a block is given, constant/class variable lookup is not affected. This can be used to add methods to a class. module_eval returns the result of evaluating its argument.</p>

<h5>module_exec</h5>

<p>Evaluates the given block in the context of the class/module. The method defined in the block will belong to the receiver. Any arguments passed to the method will be passed to the block. This can be used if the block needs to access instance variables.</p>

<h5>name</h5>

<p>Returns the name of the module module. Returns nil for anonymous modules.</p>

<h5>prepend</h5>

<p>Invokes Module.prepend_features on each parameter in reverse order.</p>

<h5>private_class_method</h5>

<p>Makes existing class methods private. Often used to hide the default constructor new.</p>

<h5>private_constant</h5>

<p>Makes a list of existing constants private.</p>

<h5>private_instance_methods</h5>

<p>Returns a list of the private instance methods defined in module. If the optional parameter is false, the methods of any ancestors are not included.</p>

<h5>private_method_defined?</h5>

<p>Returns true if the named private method is defined by _mod_ (or its included modules and, if module is a class, its ancestors).</p>

<h5>protected_instance_methods</h5>

<p>Returns a list of the protected instance methods defined in module. If the optional parameter is false, the methods of any ancestors are not included.</p>

<h5>protected_method_defined?</h5>

<p>Returns true if the named protected method is defined by module (or its included modules and, if module is a class, its ancestors).</p>

<h5>public_class_method</h5>

<p>Makes a list of existing class methods public.</p>

<h5>public_constant</h5>

<p>Makes a list of existing constants public.</p>

<h5>public_instance_method</h5>

<p>Similar to instance_method, searches public method only.</p>

<h5>public_instance_methods</h5>

<p>Returns a list of the public instance methods defined in module. If the optional parameter is false, the methods of any ancestors are not included.</p>

<h5>public_method_defined?</h5>

<p>Returns true if the named public method is defined by module (or its included modules and, if module is a class, its ancestors).</p>

<h5>remove_class_variable</h5>

<p>Removes the definition of the symbol, returning that constant&rsquo;s value.</p>

<h5>singleton_class?</h5>

<p>Returns true if module is a singleton class or false if it is an ordinary class or module.</p>

<h4>Private instance methods</h4>

<p>Private instance methods in Module are mainly used in internal classes level.</p>

<h5>alias_method</h5>

<p>Makes new_name a new copy of the method old_name. This can be used to retain access to methods that are overridden.</p>

<h5>append_features</h5>

<p>When this module is included in another, Ruby calls append_features in this module, passing it the receiving module in module. Ruby&rsquo;s default implementation is to add the constants, methods, and module variables of this module to module if this module has not already been added to module or one of its ancestors.</p>

<h5>define_method</h5>

<p>Defines an instance method in the receiver. The method parameter can be a Proc, a Method or an UnboundMethod object. If a block is specified, it is used as the method body. This block is evaluated using instance_eval, a point that is tricky to demonstrate because define_method is private.</p>

<h5>extend_object</h5>

<p>Extends the specified object by adding this module&rsquo;s constants and methods (which are added as singleton methods). This is the callback method used by Object#extend.</p>

<h5>extended</h5>

<p>The equivalent of included, but for extended modules.</p>

<h5>included</h5>

<p>Callback invoked whenever the receiver is included in another module or class. This should be used in preference to Module.append_features if your code wants to perform some action when a module is included in another.</p>

<h5>method_added</h5>

<p>Invoked as a callback whenever an instance method is added to the receiver.</p>

<h5>method_removed</h5>

<p>Invoked as a callback whenever an instance method is removed from the receiver.</p>

<h5>method_undefined</h5>

<p>Invoked as a callback whenever an instance method undefined but called from the receiver.</p>

<h5>module_function</h5>

<p>Creates module functions for the named methods. These functions may be called with the module as a receiver, and also become available as instance methods to classes that mix in the module. Module functions are copies of the original, and so may be changed independently. The instance-method versions are made private. If used with no arguments, subsequently defined methods become module functions. String arguments are converted to symbols.
prepend_features When this module is prepended in another, Ruby calls prepend_features in this module, passing it the receiving module in module. Ruby&rsquo;s default implementation is to overlay the constants, methods, and module variables of this module to mod if this module has not already been added to mod or one of its ancestors. See also Module#prepend.</p>

<h5>prepended</h5>

<p>The equivalent of included, but for prepended modules.</p>

<h5>refine</h5>

<p>Refine klass in the receiver. Returns an overlaid module.</p>

<h5>remove_const</h5>

<p>Removes the definition of the given constant, returning that constant&rsquo;s previous value. If that constant referred to a module, this will not change that module&rsquo;s name and can lead to confusion.
remove_method Removes the method identified by symbol from the current class. For an example, see Module.undef_method.</p>

<h5>undef_method</h5>

<p>Prevents the current class from responding to calls to the named method. Contrast this with remove_method, which deletes the method from the particular class; Ruby will still search superclasses and mixed-in modules for a possible receiver. String arguments are converted to symbols.</p>
